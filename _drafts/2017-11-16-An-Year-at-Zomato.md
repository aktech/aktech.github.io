Hi! there, It's been over a month since my last day at Zomato, I have planned this post for a while now.
Probably now its the right time to pen down my thoughts on the last 1 year at Zomato. It all started on
3rd October 2016, my first day at Zomato. I have been a fan of Zomato well before I joined them mainly due
to their amazing social media humor. I was very excited to start my first job there. The first day started
with the induction programme (*An induction programme is an important process for bringing staff into an organisation.*).
Along with me there were 8-10 more of them and two of them joined in the tech team (Suhaib and Anu). I was an
off-campus and off-season hire so there weren't a lot of tech people joining, except the three of us. The induction
introduced us to various teams and their job. In the evening after the induction, the HR took me to introduce
me to my team. She told me that I would be working with the ML team (though the team was mainly known as Reviews Team).
It was a team of 3 before me, they were Shubham Chaudhary, Amit Kushwaha and Paras Arora (our manager).

My first job was to create a dashboard to have the ability to easily create the collections on Zomato.
A Collection is a set of restaurants based on various themes like Biryani, Desserts, etc. The dashboard was supposed to be
based on the Review Highlights (it extracts tags from the reviews based on 3 aspects of a restaurant
such as food, service and ambience), which Amit and Shubham were working on for a while. The creation of that
dashboard was quite a challenging task for me as I had no prior experience with the frontend, but thanks to
Shubham who explained me some basics such as what is an ajax call and Amit who introduced me to the design
of review highlights to understand the data I need to use for the dashboard. Apart from the technical
aspects my biggest learning was the estimation of project requires thorough understanding & planning of
each and every aspect of the product, this came through the fact that I estimated its completion time as 2 weeks,
which took over two weeks.

Below are the major takeaways from my learnings throughout the last one year:

* Time estimation is one of the toughest job in software engineering, the key is to try to break the job into independent
units and try estimating the time for each unit.

* What can go wrong will definitely go wrong i.e. things will definitely break in production, test rigorously before pushing
even if it is an as trivial change as `2 + 2 = 4`.

* Writing tests is a very good idea and writing tests is NEVER a wastage of time, it will definitely make your life easier.

* Lets push it now and will improve it later doesn't works. You'll never comeback to improve an old code, just because you
promised your past self.

* Decisions from discussions should not be based on mere opinions, explore all the possible options for solving a problem
write pros and cons and see where difference of pros and cons is the greatest.

* The best way to ship complex products is to first ship a simpler version of it and see how far it goes and then
incremently build upon it as it better to ship a simpler version in one month than to wait for an year for a full
fledged product.

* Always ask why? Don't just do a job for the sake of doing it, first ask why you need to do what you have been
asked to do and ask another why if you're not satisfied with the reasoning.

* Always have the answer to What, Why and How of the project you're working on. Try explaining it to yourself, if you're
able to satisfy yourself, then you're good to go.

* Don't just ask question just because you're too lazy to try hard to google the solution. Remember it's science, not magic!
There is always a reason why its not working.
