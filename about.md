Hi there! thanks for stumbling upon my website. I am a Software Engineer at [Powervault](https://www.powervault.co.uk/),
a London based green tech startup. Previously I was working as a Software Engineer in
[Zomato's](https://www.zomato.com/) Machine Learning Team. Before Zomato I was a Software
Engineering Intern at [HackerEarth's](http://www.hackerearth.com) R & D Team. I also
participated in Google Summer of Code 2017 & 2016 as a Mentor in [SymPy](http://www.sympy.org/en/index.html)
organization. In 2015 I participated as a Student under [Python Software Foundation](https://www.python.org/psf/)

Computing Engineer from [Delhi Technological University](http://dtu.ac.in/)
