Hi there! It's been sometime now since my last blog post, It's probably the right time to write one now. Yesterday, I gave a talk on SymPy at Python Delhi User group Meetup at [CSDS](https://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&hl=en&q=29%2C+Rajpur+Road%2C+Delhi%2C+in), New Delhi. Things never go the way you want, an hour was wasted in just setting up Anaconda on everyone's system, eventually I had to cut on the material I could demonstrate, though It was nice to see that people were very enthusiatic about SymPy, they actively solved excercises. It was fun interacting with everyone.

Here is a Pic of the Seminar room at CSDS:

I should also admit that, I have increased my appetite for attending conferences and meetups, these days. In the last 4 months I have attended 3 Meetups (PyDelhi Meetup) and 1 Conference (PyCon India 2015). I think this is one of the best things I have done in last few years & I would recommend anyone with a slight interest in Python either Beginner or Expert should attend [PyDelhi](http://www.pydelhi.org) [Meetups](http://www.meetup.com/pydelhi/events/). Looking forward to more such meetups and conferences.

I gave SymPy stickers to everyone who solved atleast one excercise (Since, I didn't had enough stickers).
