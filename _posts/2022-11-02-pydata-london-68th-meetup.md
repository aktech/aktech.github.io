It's been 5 years, since I [last spoke](https://iamit.in/blog/pydata-london-39th-meetup) at PyData London.
Similar to what happened 5 years ago, this time also, we had a speaker cancellation, so I
jumped in as the last minute speaker, although I had proposed to speak next month.

The meetup started with [Emlyn](https://twitter.com/emlynclay), welcoming folks to the meetup
and introducing them to PyData London. He also shared updates around the Python
community, like the release of [Python 3.11](https://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/3.11.html) and
conferences happening around the world. It was quite fascinating to realize the size of
just PyData London with over 11000+ members, which is about ~5% of all the PyData Meetup's
members around the globe!

The first talk of the day was by Adrian from Intel. He talked about the [OpenVINO
toolkit](https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/openvino). It was a pretty cool talk about
how you can run faster real-time inference with just 7 lines of code. In the end he also
did a live demo of him moving around his webcam and the model was able to infer person/objects
in real time.

After the first talk, my turn came in after the break. I managed to test the HDMI connectivity
during the break to avoid any surprises. At first it was quite intimidating to get on the
stage after quite a while. The last time I spoke at a conference in person was in 2018,
before pandemic at [Swiss Python Summit](https://www.python.org/events/python-events/637/).
You almost lose the idea of public speaking in that period of time and so many people looking
at you at the same time, it always feels like as if you're doing/saying something wrong,
which did happens a few times in the talk, but overall it went very well.

I talked about [Nebari](https://nebari.dev/). It is an open source data science platform.
It was previously called as QHub. I have spent a bunch on time working on Nebari
at Quansight. We recently did the rename from QHub -> Nebari and it was the first
talk after that. Recently we did a lot of work on the documentation and release to
make it user friendly. I would highly recommend trying Nebari, if you have a data science
team that need the ease of collaboration, compute and environment management.

Here is one of the tweets from [@pydatalondon](https://twitter.com/pydatalondon) during the talk:

I'm planning to do more of this in future, hopefully with more notice in advance.
PyData London is probably one of the best meetups I have
ever attended. I would highly recommend it.
