Hi there! I recently wrote a blog on my experiences and takeaways
[working at Zomato](/blog/zomato). It was an amazing journey
and I am happy that I got the chance to be part of it. Few weeks ago I moved to
London to join a green tech startup called [Powervault](https://www.powervault.co.uk/),
currently I am working in their Backend team and will soon be moving to the
Data Science team. It is a small startup based out of central London.
Powervault is an intelligent, affordable electricity storage system for the home,
which reduces your electricity bills by enabling you to store and use free solar
energy or cheap, off-peak electricity.

It's my 4th week in London, I have been here twice earlier, though mainly as a tourist.
It has been amazing so far, looking forward to exciting times ahead.
