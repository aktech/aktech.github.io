After writing the year 2022's review blog post in the December 2023,
my only expectation for the rest of 2023 is to pen this one before the
onset of 2024 as I had a hard time recalling the events of the previous year.
Let's try to recall whatever I can, starting with my work summary.

## Work

In 2023 I worked for Quansight throughout the year. Here are some of the projects I
contributed to:

### Papyri

Papyri is a set of tools to build, publish, install and render documentation within
IPython and Jupyter. Papyri parses docs either via tree-sitter or by numpy doc, that
parsed docs is represented as hand-crafted custom AST and then that's rendered as html
and also in Jupyter. I had the chance to work on its AST, the idea was to adopt MyST's
spec as it's more widely adopted by the community and has better out of the box
support for rendering.

### Pyflyby

It's a  a set of Python programming productivity tools such as `autoimporter`: automatically
imports symbols when needed, `tidy-imports`: adds missing ‘import’s, removes unused ‘import’s,
and also reformats import blocks, `reformat-imports`: reformats import blocks. I worked on
mostly bug fixes.

### Nebari

Nebari is an open source data science platform for various cloud providers.
This year I spent some time on Nebari on writing on integration testing of the
deployed Nebari to increase confidence in release and testing.


### JHub App Launcher

JupyterHub Apps Launcher is a generalized server launcher, to launch anything like say
a Flask Server, FastAPI server or a Panel Dashboard, Streamlit using JupyterHub spawner.
