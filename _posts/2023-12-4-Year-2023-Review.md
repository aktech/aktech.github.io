After writing the year [2022's review blog post](/blog/year-2022-review) in the December 2023,
my only expectation for the rest of 2023 is to pen this one before the
onset of 2024 as I had a hard time recalling the events of the previous year.
Let's try to recall whatever I can, starting with my work summary.

## Work

In 2023 I worked for [Quansight](https://quansight.com?ref=amit-blog) throughout the year. Here are some of the projects I
contributed to:

### Papyri

Papyri is a set of tools to build, publish, install and render documentation within
IPython and Jupyter. Papyri parses docs either via tree-sitter or by numpy doc, that
parsed docs is represented as hand-crafted custom AST and then that's rendered as html
and also in Jupyter. I had the chance to work on its AST, the idea was to adopt MyST's
spec as it's more widely adopted by the community and has better out of the box
support for rendering.

### Pyflyby

[Pyflyby](https://deshaw.github.io/pyflyby/) is a set of Python programming productivity
tools such as `autoimporter`: automatically imports symbols when needed, `tidy-imports`: adds
missing ‚Äòimport‚Äôs, removes unused ‚Äòimport‚Äôs, and also reformats import blocks,
`reformat-imports`: reformats import blocks. I worked on mostly bug fixes.

### Nebari

[Nebari](nebari.dev) is an open source data science platform for various cloud providers.
This year I spent some time on Nebari on writing on integration testing of the
deployed Nebari to increase confidence in release and testing.


### JHub App Launcher

[JupyterHub Apps Launcher](https://github.com/nebari-dev/jhub-apps) is a generalized
server launcher, to launch anything like say a Flask Server, FastAPI server or a Panel
Dashboard, Streamlit using JupyterHub spawner.

## Personal Work

### Cirun

I spent time improving [cirun.io](https://cirun.io?ref=amit-blog) this year and managed to make it a
profitable business. I also managed to help conda-forge (a community-led recipes,
infrastructure and distributions for Conda) use GPU CI for building packages via
access controls runners created on demand by cirun on OpenStack running on a baremetal
machine, a details blog post is coming soon.

### Codecinema

It was a little side project to take beautiful snapshots and gif/mp4 of code
snippets. Try it out here: [codecinema.io](https://codecinema.io?ref=amit-blog)

## Personal Life

### Theatre

I was part this play called Maskerade, it's Stephen Briggs adaptation of Terry Pratchett's novel.
I played a few characters named "Tommy Cripps" and "Kevin". It was the second theatre show I have
been part of and first non musical play. It was quite a satisfying experience being part of this.
It was really an excellent learning experience.
