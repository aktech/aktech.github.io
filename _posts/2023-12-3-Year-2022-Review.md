Year 2022 was quite an year for me. Apart from travelling around the world twice,
this year was quite happening for me, witnessing various developments in professional
as well as personal life.

## Work

I worked for [Quansight](http://quansight.com/careers) for most of the year, except for 3 months break
I took in summer. I worked on various Open Source and client projects this year. Some of the notable ones:

## Making GPUs accessible via Array API

I worked on this during the start of the year, which started during the end of 2021.
More about it can be read in the blog [here](https://labs.quansight.org/blog/2022/03/making-gpus-accessible-to-pydata-ecosystem-via-array-api).

## Nebari

Formerly known as QHub. I spent some time contributing to [Nebari](https://nebari.dev).

## Risk Optimization for a Financial Client

This was a POC for a financial client, which involved optimizing some risk calculations
using PyData libraries. I don't remember the exact details, those are the perks of writing
the review blog an year late.

## GPU Server for conda-forge via Cirun

This was one of the most challenging projects I worked on last year. The goal was to create
a service that makes use of a beefy Machine with GPUs for continuous integration, primarily
for conda-forge. [conda-forge](https://conda-forge.org/) is a community-led collection of recipes,
build infrastructure and distributions for the conda package manager.

The machine has following configuration:

- Model: AMD EPYC 7352 24-Core Processor
- Architecture: x86_64, 32-bit, 64-bit
- 48 Cores & ~500 GB Memory
- 6x NVIDIA Tesla V100

This service was achieved using [OpenStack](https://www.openstack.org/) and
[cirun.io](https://cirun.io). A more detailed blog post is coming soon.


## Personal Work

Just like last year, I spent most of my spare time building/improving [cirun.io](https://cirun.io)
and managed to make my first $ from this project.
