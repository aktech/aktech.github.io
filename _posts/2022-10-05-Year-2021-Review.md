So, finally the time has come to write this one. I was quite proud of myself, when
I managed to write the [previous year review blog (2020)](https://iamit.in/blog/year-2020-review),
5 days before the year ended. Unfortunately, this time I am only 10 months late. I can blame 100 things,
but the truth is I have been lazy. Okay, enough of guilt trip, lets get on with the review.

So, at the start of the year 2021, I moved to Manchester for 6 months, thanks to pandemic, there
wasn't much happening in London either, so left for Manchester. Now, why Manchester?
I was looking to stay in a city, reasonably far from London. Birmingham was
too close to London and Edinburgh was too far, so Manchester made the cut.

# Work

Just like most of 2020, I spent pretty much all of my time working for [Quansight](https://quansight.com).
Most of the work I did in 2021 was open source. Some notable ones are:

## Sgkit

[Sgkit](https://pystatgen.github.io/sgkit/latest/) is a toolkit for population and statistical genetics in Python. My work involved
implementing pairwise distance between all the samples in genomics analysis. In simple
terms the problem reduces to finding pairwise distance between all the row vectors in
a 2D Matrix.

## Making GPUs accessible via Array API

The libraries in PyData ecosystem like scipy, scikit-learn, scikit-image are largely
limited to single-threaded operations on CPU (apart from some exceptions). Due to the
popularity and accessibility of GPU hardware, they have become extremely popular in
PyData Ecosystem. Therefore, it is very important to have the ability to harness the
power of GPUs in typical computations. Since a typical user in PyData ecosystem is
already familiar with the APIs of these libraries, it makes sense to be able to use GPUs
without writing hardware specific code by just changing the array backend like NumPy, CuPy.
This work achieved this via [Array API](https://data-apis.org/array-api/latest/).

Making GPUs accessible to the PyData Ecosystem via the Array API Standard.

# Personal Work
## GitHub Actions on your cloud: Cirun.io
<img src="/assets/2021_review/cirun-logo.png" width="200">

This is the service I launched in March 2021. GitHub Actions is great and it's
my favorite CI/CD, but it has some limitations:

- Machine size is limited to 2 cores, 7GB RAM
- No support for special hardware like say GPUs
- Expensive for private repositories: $0.48 per hour

I faced these problems myself at work and came up with an idea to build a
service to run GitHub Actions on user's cloud provider. Fortunately GitHub
provides the open source runner software to create self-hosted runners
on any machine of choice. [Cirun](https://cirun.io) creates on-demand runners on user's cloud
provider.

Here is some money people saved by using [Cirun.io](https://cirun.io)

# Personal Life

Personal life hasn't been very exciting in the first half of 2021, due to
pandemic and the new city that I moved into.
