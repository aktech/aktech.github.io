Hi there! Today I gave a talk on Python MRO at [PyDelhi](http://pydelhi.org) [Meetup](http://www.meetup.com/pydelhi/events/226049223/) at [Ramanujan College](http://www.ramanujancollege.ac.in/index.php), Delhi. MRO stands for method resolution order *which defines the "class search path" used by Python to search for the right method to use in classes having multi-inheritance*. Below is an example

```python
class A:
    def whoami(self):
        print("I am A")

class B(A):
    def whoami(self):
        print("I am B")

class C(A):
    def whoami(self):
        print("I am C")

class D(B, C):
    pass
```

```python
d = D()
d.whoami()
```
To get the output of above example Python has a predefined algorithm called as method resolution order, which defines the order in which python would search for the method `whoami` in the classes from which D inherits. To understand more about the working of mro see the [slides](http://slides.com/aktech/python-mro/) of talk.

#### Motivation for the talk
The motivation behind this talk is my failure to answer some simple mro based question in an interview with a bangalore based startup a month ago. I realized that its one of the basic language features which every Python programmer should be aware of & teaching something is probably the best way to learn something, so is delivering a talk! It's well said by Albert Einstein:

> If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough.

It is always a wonderful experience delivering a talk at PyDelhi Meetup or at any conference, I plan to do more of it in future. I always say this & would say it again, if you like Python or interested in learning then you must attend PyDelhi Meetups. See you on the next meetup ;)

Feel free to reach out to me for any feedbacks or query regarding anything at me [at] iamit [dot] in.
