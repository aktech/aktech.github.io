It's been a while since I wrote my last blog post, more than an year now. This post is
basically a summary of what I have been upto personally and professionally in last one year.

### Professional Developments

At the start of the year I was working at Powervault, the green tech startup in the Central London. I worked
with some very interesting people there, there were only a couple of software guys. I left that by the end of January. The reason for that was, there wasn't much work for me, it was more of a hardware focused company and there wasn't much room for me to grow and learn and I wasn't in particular happy with the direction of company.

In February, I joined The Telegraph, a popular news tech company in Central London. I joined as a
Platform Engineer in the Data Platform Team. I was quite excited about my new role as I had never done
any sort of Data Engineering. My team at The Telegraph was about 8 people strong and was quite multi cultural.
This is where I learnt for the first time, what is a scrum master and what is agile. I left The Telegraph in
May 2018, It was a tough decision. I had an amazing time working there. The people were very social and helpful. The reason I left it was due to the fact that work was a bit slow paced as you would
expect in any big company. Have been worked in a fast paced environment like Zomato, it was difficult for
me to adapt to it as things move very slowly and the learning curve wasn't anything close to steep. Although
I do sometimes think, that I should have given more time there, as I worked there only for 4 months.

I had only two basic expectations for my next job, i.e. interesting and challenging.
A friend of mine suggested to start contracting, i.e. to work as a Contract Developer, where you
work with various companies on contract basis, primarily because you get to work on a variety of things in
multiple domains. The contract is basically between your company ([aktech labs](http://aktechlabs.com)) and the company you will be contracting for. This is when a recruiter contacted me for a 7 months contract with a Robotics company
in Cambridge. This sounded like an exciting opportunity. I accepted the offer and moved to Cambridge.
I worked with Cambridge Medical Robotics for little over 6 months before my contract ended in December.
It was probably the most interesting stuff I have ever worked on with some of the smartest people. It
was quite a challenging job as the system was extremely complex and huge. I learnt a lot in the last six
months.

I wrote some takeaways from my first job at Zomato in my earlier [post](https://iamit.in/blog/zomato#Takeaway),
Here are a few more of those, which are quite specific to the roles I was in this year.

* Try to avoid complexity. If it is not trivial, take a step back to what is the bare minimum required by
the user rather than nice-to-have or anticipating need, and enumerate simpler solutions with trade-offs
before going too deep in implementation. Then a more informed implementation decision can be made (maybe
someone else has extra information about what the user needs/doesn't need)

* Code comments: I have always been of the opinion that code should be self commenting, but I realised in my
last job that sometimes the system is too complex to be self explanatory, in such cases comments are
invaluable.

* If the number of iterations in the code review are increasing over time or you're getting similar comments,
then you're not learning. Challenge yourself to have minimum required changes when sending for code review,
this can be achieved by doing a code review yourself first, and doing it seriously!

### What's Next?

This month (December) I went home (India) for a month to spend time with my family and friends. I will
be back after third week in January to start the next contract in London and will be moving back to London in
a couple of months.
