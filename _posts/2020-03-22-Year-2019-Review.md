I wrote the following in my previous blog post and it applies in this one as well.
> It's been a while since I wrote my last blog post, more than an year now. This post is
basically a summary of what I have been upto personally and professionally in last one year.

## Professional Developments

Unlike 2018, when I worked for a number of companies, 2019 was much more straightforward, I worked
for only one company named as [Turner & Townsend](https://www.turnerandtownsend.com/).

TL;DR : I had a great time there, would highly recommend them.

Turner and Townsend is a construction consulting company i.e. they basically do consulting
for construction companies, they don't construct themselves as per my understanding.

I worked for them as a contractor in their backend team. I was quite skeptical about joining
them initially, as I knew they were not really a tech company and their might be a lot
of bureaucracy and lack of understanding of tech. In spite of all this, I took a gamble.

Unlike my expectations it turned out a great place to work at, I learnt a lot and made some
good friends. It was a small team of roughly 10-12 developers, couple of designers and a
few product owners.

### Work

They were building a couple of applications know as **Benchmarking** and **Cost Control**.
The former is basically a tool that uses the data they produce to benchmark and model the
space, time and cost of a project and latter is kind of a banking application, which is basically
a ledger of all the financial changes during the execution of a construction project.

There were two streams of work that I was part of:

- **Backend**: which was mainly creating data models and APIs on top of them for the web
application to display them on the frontend.

- **Data Pipelining**: Pulling the data from various sources such as csv, excel, sql servers
from the business into the system. Since there was a continuous need for creating data models
and doing it via SQLAlchemy and then writing usual APIs for those models was a lot of
repetitive work. To cater for this we used an open source tool called [genyrator](https://github.com/turner-townsend/genyrator)
(which was written in house) for generating models and APIs by just writing some abstract definitions.

We used [Apache Airflow](https://airflow.apache.org/) to create, schedule and monitor those data pipelines.

One of the cool things about this application is that it was written in a very declarative way
using functional programming, which made it easy to write new pipelines, read, extend and maintain.
Only con is that is was sometimes hard to debug due to 100s of lambdas in the stack trace.

#### Example

To illustrate the concept mentioned above, consider a case, when you are writing an ETL pipeline that
fetches the data (say a row) from csv to the database and you want to rename a column and round a float
value in a key:

Lets us write a couple of functions that we will call as transformer, that will rename the key
and round the value of a key. These function will take keys as argument and will return a
function, which when called with a row of data (dict), will apply the above operations
and will return us a new row.

```python
def rename_key(key: str, new_name: str):
    def _rename_key(row):
        mutable_row = dict(row)
        mutable_row[new_name] = mutable_row.pop(key)
        return mutable_row
    return _rename_key

def round_value(key: str):
    def _round_value(row):
        mutable_row = dict(row)
        mutable_row[key] = round(mutable_row[key])
        return mutable_row
    return _round_value
```

Let us now define a `PipelineConfig` class that will take a data and a set of functions (Transformers)
that we can pass to it.

```python
import copy

from dataclasses import dataclass
from typing import List, Callable

@dataclass
class PipelineConfig:
    data: dict
    transformers: List[Callable]
    def run(self):
        mutable_data = copy.deepcopy(self.data)
        for transformer in self.transformers:
            mutable_data = transformer(mutable_data)
        return mutable_data
```

Now let us see our `PipelineConfig` in action

```python
pipeline = PipelineConfig(
    data={'foo': 123, 'bar': 456.456},
    transformers=[
        rename_key('foo', 'foo_new'),
        round_value('bar')
    ]
)

pipeline.run()
```
Output:

```python
{'bar': 456, 'foo_new': 123}
```

You can see in the output, that `foo` is renamed to `foo_new` and the value at `bar` is rounded to nearest integer.

The advantage of this is you can define transformers for every operation you want to perform
and then you can reuse it and if your transformer are idempotent and commutative then you
can combine any set of transformers to get your desired transformation.

## What's Next?

This year in January, I joined a fintech startup called as [Aire](https://aire.io/) as a contract Software
Engineer. They help in credit assessment, I am working in the lender side of the business. More about this
in future blog posts.

## 2020

The first quarter of 2020 is almost finished, here is a brief summary of what has happened. The gif below is
a footage of few of us trying to enter the year 2020, apparently it's quite similar for everyone, thanks to
[COVID-2019](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus_disease_2019)
