Now we have three Python Conferences in India! After PyCon India & PyDelhi
Conference, [PyCon Pune](https://pune.pycon.org/) is the first of its kind regional PyCon and I was
delighted to get a chance to attend such an amazing conference. It was a 4-day event,
with a couple of days for a conference and a couple of days for Dev Sprint. I reached
Pune on 16th Morning, thanks to [Sayan](https://twitter.com/yudocaa) and
[Chandan](https://twitter.com/chkumar246) for accommodating me at their
place. Their house was like a Hacker space throughout the conference, as a lot of
friends crashed there.

## Day 1

Day 1 started with Kushal picking us to the conference venue in his car, The
first thing that astonished me was the quote on the back of his T-Shirt:

The Conference started with the Keynote by Honza Král, who is a core contributor to
Django. He talked about his OSS Life. It was followed by a talk on "Writing
Beautiful Code" by Anand Chitipothu who is a co-author of web.py. In the Afternoon
John Hawley who is a Perl guy declared a Python programmer gave the Keynote.
John is an Interesting guy so was his talk. I and [Sanyam](http://github.com/CuriousLearner)
met him in Delhi and had a dinner together. In the evening Praveen Patil gave a talk on
"Python in my Science Classroom". He showed how he uses Python to help
kids visualize various concepts of Physics.


## Day 2

It started with Kushal again picking up from our place. He took us to
[Sidesh's](https://twitter.com/siddhesh_p) Reservedbit's office to pick
the T-Shirts for the conference. We reached there at around 9 AM. The first talk
was the Keynote by Katie Cunningham, who is a speaker, teacher, and writer
of technical books. I had met Katie in PyGotham 2016 in New York, where she
delivered a Keynote. It was nice to see her again. The day was filled with lots
of awesome talks like the Talk by Stephen Turbull describing the ways to contribute
for the development of Python. It was followed by Farhaan's talk on Pagure, which
was his GSoC Project. I met him first in PyCon India 2015 during SymPy Dev
Sprint. Then there was a talk by Noufal, who is a veteran in Python India's
Community. In the afternoon we had a Keynote by Nick Coghlan who is a core
Developer of CPython. In the evening Terri Odda gave the Keynote. I knew
about her Since my Google Summer of Code 2015, as she was representing PSF
in GSoC. It was a pleasure meeting her for the first time. In the evening
all of us went for the Dinner at the Deccan in Magarpatta City. The conference
concluded after this.


## Day 3 & 4

Day 3 and 4 were scheduled for the Dev Sprints. It was a brave decision
to have the conference on weekdays and sprints in the weekend, but it worked
well. I was glad to see the turnout. The Dev Sprint was at RedHat's Office
at Magarpatta City. This was probably the best Dev Sprint I ever had in any
of the conferences. I decided to contribute to CPython as Nick Coghlan was
mentoring for it. I submitted 4 patches into CPython, during the Dev Sprints.
After the Dev Sprint on Day 3, we went to hang around Pune. Amol took us to
a famous Vada Pav place. It was an awesome weekend. I & Sanyam left in the
evening on Day 4 to catch our flights to Delhi.

It was a marvelous experience throughout the Conference. Everything was well
Organized. Management was absolutely amazing. It was great to see the Energy
of all the Volunteers. Kudos to the organizing team of PyCon Pune.
I am looking forward to PyCon Pune 2018!
