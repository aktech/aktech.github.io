#### Abstract

SymPy is an open source computer algebra system written in pure Python.
It is built with a focus on extensibility and ease of use, through both
interactive and programmatic applications. These characteristics have led
SymPy to become a popular symbolic library for the scientific Python ecosystem.
This paper presents the architecture of SymPy, a description of its features,
and a discussion of select submodules. The supplementary material provide additional
examples and further outline details of the architecture and features of SymPy.
